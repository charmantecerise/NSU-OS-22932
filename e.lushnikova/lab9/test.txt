What Does It Really Mean to Make Art?
When we set aside our romantic notions, we see that creativity is continuous, and fueled by life itself.

SAY “THE ARTIST’S LIFE” and already we are in thrall to the old romantic myths: the garret in winter with wind lisping through the cracks, the dissolving nights at mirrored bars nursing absinthe, the empty pockets, the feral hair, the ever-looming madhouse. Or let us reach further back in time to a Taoist philosophical text circa the late fourth century B.C., which tells of a Chinese lord who summons artists for a commission. They compliantly line up before him with brushes and ink, ready to compete for the job — all but one, who trails in late, then goes back home, disrobes and sprawls on the floor before starting to paint. The lord approves: “This is a true artist!”

Implicit in the phrase “the artist’s life” is the idea that this is a life apart. We are not so quick to rhapsodize about the insurance agent’s life or the plumber’s. As the cultural critic Arne de Boever argues in “Against Aesthetic Exceptionalism” (2019), the reverential way we speak about art invests the artist with a sovereignty akin to that of a monarch or even a god, unbound by the laws that rein in the rest of us. And so the artist remains a collective fantasy, an imagined rebel on the fringes, heroically immune to propriety and the demands of capitalism, who rejects work in the conventional, soul-deadening sense, who needn’t produce according to a schedule or answer to a boss or please anyone but themselves. In this construction, art itself is not a steady practice but a matter of a moment’s revelation, created in a fever that comes out of nowhere (and that the artist may secretly fear will never come again).

But who is funding all this? We want to think of art as something pure, beyond commerce, but the artist has to eat, which requires customers (turning art into a commodity and the artist into a kind of entrepreneur), benefactors, government grants or a trust fund — or else capitulating to the system and getting a plain old job (a “real” job, as the anxious parents say). Nevertheless, the romance persists, for while we grudgingly accept wage labor as the average person’s lot, we tend to believe that such toil entails a unique suffering for the artist (and a loss for the world) because it steals time from worthier pursuits. If anything, we are suspicious of the trust funders, those who have it too easy, who don’t suffer for their art. Instead, we reserve the greatest awe for artists who work as mortals do, who accept the drudgery of ordinary existence in order to make possible a second one: the artist’s life.

This labor becomes an origin story, testament to a superhuman ability to keep the mind keen and the soul intact after hours of dulling tasks. We thrill to contemporary tales of the German filmmaker Werner Herzog pulling night shifts welding steel, the American novelist Octavia Butler monitoring quality control at a potato chip factory or the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei cleaning houses. The American composer Philip Glass famously shocked the Australian-born art critic Robert Hughes in the 1970s by showing up to install his dishwasher — now here is the plumber’s life — and the American poet Wallace Stevens worked in insurance for nearly four decades, until his death in 1955, the same year he won the Pulitzer Prize. Sometimes, an artist astounds in two fields, like the Nobel Prize winner Toni Morrison, who changed the course of American literature not only as a writer but as the first Black woman editor at Random House, where in the 1970s she published groundbreaking fiction by Gayl Jones and Toni Cade Bambara and the urgent writings of the activists Angela Davis and Huey P. Newton — and where she kept working for more than a decade after she’d gained renown as a novelist in her own right.

Even artists fortunate enough to be able to devote themselves wholly to their craft must draft budgets, marshal resources and sometimes manage teams to realize their visions (the administrator’s life!). As for the conception of artistic genius as a series of stray, unearned shocks of brilliance in lives otherwise given over to indolence and excess, what of the hours of training and repetition, of inhaling paint fumes, ripping out seams, running algorithms for a torqued facade, poring over books (perhaps to postpone the anguish of writing one) or plodding through scales at the piano? The epigram “If I don’t practice for one day, I know it; two days, the critics know it; three days, the world knows it” has been attributed to musicians from the 20th-century American jazz trumpeter and singer Louis Armstrong to the Polish pianist Ignace Jan Paderewski, born in 1860 — who, speaking of day jobs, was also Poland’s prime minister and signatory to the 1919 Treaty of Versailles.

Then there are the hours of staring into blankness, be it of a canvas, page, stage or your own soul. This, too, is work, the mind trying to remember itself and what it is capable of. From the outside, it might look like idleness (from the inside, terror). Maybe there is no such thing as the artist’s life, at least not as some insurgent or louche ideal; maybe, in a world otherwise ever more fine-tuned to boosting productivity and maximizing efficiency, there is simply a life that allows for art — that makes space for it, however long it takes.

ONCE, THERE WAS scarcely a distinction between artist and artisan. Those who made art were recognized foremost as laborers, people who worked with their hands. The word “art” did not originally signify something exalted and separate from the dailiness of life; it comes from the Latin ars by way of translation from the Greek techne, which means, simply, skill: “the skill required to make an object, a house, a statue, a ship, a bedstead, a pot, an article of clothing and moreover also the skill required to command an army, to measure a field, to sway an audience,” the Polish philosopher and art historian Wladyslaw Tatarkiewicz writes in “A History of Six Ideas” (1980).

In the Western world, nearly all of what we think of today as the fine arts were once the opposite, vulgares to the ancient Romans and “mechanical” to the scholars of the Middle Ages. Painting, sculpture, architecture, theater, the making of clothes, cooking: These were considered physical, not cerebral, pursuits, alongside medicine and agriculture — utilitarian matters of expertise. Music was exempted as a subset of mathematics, while poetry, Tatarkiewicz writes, was treated as “a kind of philosophy or prophecy, a prayer or confession.” Artisans apprenticed and trained in adherence to standards set by guilds, an early form of consumer protection and quality control. (Similar systems developed in Asia and throughout the Islamic world.) They earned respect as masters of codified craft, not as innovators with unique insight and vision.

Even in the 15th and 16th centuries in Europe, when painting was elevated to the liberal arts, the polymathic Leonardo da Vinci continued to dismiss sculpture as merely manual, mimetic rather than inventive, recreating without thought what already exists in the world — although Michelangelo, a generation younger, disagreed. By this time, however, the character of the artist had become a subject of interest, the more so as members of a newly prosperous mercantile class sought to telegraph their ascendance by commissioning portraits and acquiring art. The 16th-century Italian painter Giovanni Battista Armenini wrote disdainfully of audiences who presumed artists to be creatures of vice and capriciousness (and were perhaps secretly titillated at the thought) but also of the “many ignorant artists” who promoted this caricature, believing themselves “to be very exceptional by affecting melancholy and eccentricity.”

Tatarkiewicz points out that the shift in thinking about artists started around the same time as a downturn in the European economy, which made art an appealing alternative investment. But for art to confer status, the people who made it had to be distinguished from common laborers. Cleaving artist from artisan was an assignment of value, both aesthetic and monetary. By the 18th century in Europe, this transformation was complete: from an industrious and sometimes anonymous plier of a trade to an individual with a singular perspective — a genius with privileged access to the sublime, pledged to bring the world higher truths. (Other cultures, resistant to the Western narrative of individualism, have not always embraced this definition.) Not that this new loftiness necessarily translated into material reward. Indeed, the less reward, the better: Part of the myth of the artist’s life was that artists fed off and even required poverty and torment in order to create, like the Spaniard Pablo Picasso in the early 1900s in Paris, as yet unknown, living in squalor and burning his drawings to keep from freezing to death.

The West loves dichotomies, the German philosopher Byung-Chul Han notes with a gentle jab in “Good Entertainment: A Deconstruction of the Western Passion Narrative” (2019). If we take as givens the partitioning of good and evil, heaven and earth, high and low, the world that could be and the world that is, then art that does not explicitly strive for transcendence — for “an emphatic otherness that would lift it above the false world,” in Han’s poetic evocation — risks getting muddled with the mundane. How exhausting, this insistence on art and art making as forever agonized and ecstatic. Why shouldn’t the artist also be a honer of craft, a sorter of nuts and bolts, as attuned to the quotidian as to the imagined greater beyond?

THE COUNTERPOINT TO transcendence, in the language of religion, is immanence: believing that the sublime is not outside the bounds of the humanly perceived world but manifest within it; that the timeless is also present in the immediate and ephemeral. “The artist rummages through the world, attends lovingly on everyday things and tells their story,” Han writes. What defines an artist may be not so much the snatching at eternity as the tinkering, the grubbing in the dirt, the quiet attention to the most seemingly ordinary and insignificant details — not the grand unfurling of the universe but life at its smallest.

And so the architect Toshiko Mori plants carrots in her garden as “part of the habit of creation,” and the choreographer Raja Feather Kelly waits for the subway, contemplating the uncertainty of arrival. For the artists in the pages that follow — not all of whom necessarily consider themselves to be artists — life unfolds, eddies, sometimes stalls. There are chores, along with reprieves from work of any kind. The procession of minutes and hours doesn’t quite add up to what we think of as a workday, in part because the border is drawn not between work and life but between making art (which might happen anywhere, at any time) and the living that sustains it. In some ways artists must function as athletes, building in moments of recovery, ice baths for the mind.

Work itself is unmoored in time and place. The conceptual artist Rirkrit Tiravanija doesn’t even have a studio: “I don’t wake up and go to a place where I sit down and make things.” Instead, a day — a life — is a continuous act of creation, of work that never properly ends but is neither fully visible. The 19th-century French writer Gustave Flaubert once took five days, working 12 hours a day, to write one page. (Note that he was single and had no children.) How to explain the song that somehow emerges out of the same chords strummed over and over; the commotion and sense of impending doom backstage and then the pin-drop hush on opening night; the vast stillness that precedes the decisive gesture?

For 30 years, the artist James Nares, now known as Jamie, has made paintings that each consist of a single, giant brushstroke, minimalist and maximalist at once. It’s “made in a matter of seconds,” she says, but it takes days to find the shape, engage the muscle and, perhaps most crucially, to make mistakes, each squeegeed off so the canvas is blank anew. The finished piece or performance, the artwork is just the iceberg’s tip, leaving unseen the labor below.

STILL, THIS IS a radical idea of work, especially in an age when we are taught that we are what we do — do to earn money, that is — and that the proper pageant of life is slotting ourselves dutifully from birth to school to the office, factory, plant, mill or farm, and then the grave. “The sacred seriousness of play has entirely given way to the profane seriousness of work and production,” Han writes in “The Disappearance of Rituals: A Topology of the Present” (2020). Without play, life “comes to resemble mere survival. It lacks splendor, sovereignty, intensity.” We work and cordon off play in a window of time labeled leisure, a brief break that serves only to affirm the centrality (and stultification) of work.

By contrast, the work of art is flagrantly unproductive, even anti-productive. “The poetic does not produce,” Han writes, pointing to how poems disavow language as merely a means “to communicate information”; instead, as the 20th-century French cultural theorist Jean Baudrillard wrote, “the poetic is the insurrection of language against its own laws.” The other arts likewise conspire against the pragmatic, the optimal, the proven result. It’s not the artist’s life that’s excessive but art, in its abundance or austerity, its insistence on the urgency of a particular configuration or absence of colors, shapes, textures, gestures, sounds or words that might be brimming or bereft of meaning, that might address the most pressing issues of the day or exist only to announce, “This is beautiful,” or, “I am here.”

The American philosopher C. Thi Nguyen notes in “Games and the Art of Agency” (2019) that there are two kinds of players in any given game: “An achievement player plays to win; a striving player temporarily acquires an interest in winning for the sake of the struggle.” Art makes an argument for creation, for struggle, as an end in itself. The artist strives not to collect the most toys, rack up virtual kills or race to the jackpot square but simply to be in the game, map its corners, make time stretch — and maybe figure out a way to hack this world, change the rules and free us all. For victory is just a blip. The best games never end.
